# Ambient Getting Started Tutorial

Ambient is a game engine written in Rust, focusing on modding and multiplayer features.

In this tutorial, we will write a simple shooting game from scratch, and in the process, we will show you the basic features of the engine, providing resources such as documentation, reference, examples, games, etc. Hopefully this will give you a good idea of how to use Ambient to make your own game.

## Prerequisites

Rust 1.67 or later is required to build Ambient. You can install Rust by following the instructions on [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

Rust programming experience is not required to follow this tutorial, but it is recommended. If you are new to Rust, you can learn the basics of the language on [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn).

To install Ambient, see (here)[https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/user/installing.html].

It's also recommended to setup your IDE for a better Ambient dev experience (see [here](https://ambientrun.github.io/Ambient/user/setting_up_ide.html)).
